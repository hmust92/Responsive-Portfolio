# Responsive Portfolio

This is my basic portfolio, but I have added media queries to make it responsive for 980px width, 768px width, and 640px width.
The live link is available on the main repo page.

To open it locally, open your terminal and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/hmust92/Responsive-Portfolio.git
```

After that, open it in your browser.
